**Demo for using `git push` command from git bash**

I've performed a demonstration to push files in my local repository to the remote one in my profile.

And yes, it worked by using `git push`, including two other git commands beforehand: `remote` and `branch`

These commands should be entered inside git bash while in the local directory:

* `git remote add origin` <clone-url>
* `git branch -M main`
* `git push -u origin main`
